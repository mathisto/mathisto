I didn't think anyone looked at these things, but here you are!

I keep an updated copy of [my Resume/CV published here](resume.pdf) if you are interested in that sort of thing.

### Significant examples of my work can be found in these (and other) open source projects:
- ðŸŽ¥ [ytfzf](https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf): [A pure POSIX shell script that lets you watch youtube videos at the CLI.]
- ðŸ“¦ [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker): [Check out my contrib to the Tolkien Legendarium. LOL.]
- ðŸ§ª [VA.gov APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api): [Modernizing the VA.gov API affordances]
