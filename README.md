# Hullo!

I didn't think anyone looked at these things, but here you are! I'm a bit of an odd duck; I lived underwater for 4.5 years. I have been enthusiatically computing for 30 years, 10 of them professionally. I keep an updated copy of [my Resume/CV published here](resume.pdf) if you are interested in that sort of thing.

### Projects I have contributed to:
- 📦 [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker): [Check out my massive overhaul of Tolkien Legendarium!]
- 🎥 [ytfzf](https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf): [A pure POSIX shell script that lets you watch youtube videos at the CLI.]
- 🍊 [Tangering](https://github.com/udayvir-singh/tangerine.nvim): [Sweet Fennel integration for Neovim]
- 🧪 [VA.gov APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api): [The API backend for the VA.gov website]
