# Welcome to the Enchanted Realm of Code! ✨🔮

Greetings, fellow wanderer of the digital realms! I am Matt Kelly, a sorcerer of code, [conjuring magic through the ethereal art of programming](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/Chapter-1.xhtml#Chapter-1). Step into my enchanted GitHub sanctuary, where the lines of code intertwine like spells, and the languages I wield are the ancient incantations of our digital universe.

I keep an updated copy of [my Resume/CV published here](resume.pdf) if you are interested in that sort of thing.

Prepare to be mesmerized by the enchantments I've crafted with the following mystical languages:

🔥 **Ruby**: Ruby, the fiery gem of the programming world, allows me to cast spells with elegance and grace, invoking the power of its enchanting syntax to create mesmerizing applications!

🌟 **JavaScript**: Behold the spellbinding power of JavaScript, weaving captivating web experiences that dance beneath the moonlit skies of the internet!

🌱 **Clojure**: Clojure, the mystical language of the Lisp family, enables me to tap into the depths of functional programming, invoking the power of immutable data structures and threading macros to create elegant and magical solutions!

✨ **Python**: Python, the arcane language of serpents and wizards, enables me to summon data from the depths of the cosmos and weave intricate algorithms with a flick of my wand!

🔮 **FORTH**: FORTH, the ancient language of stack manipulation, allows me to delve into the depths of low-level magic, invoking the power of simplicity and control to create efficient and spellbinding software!

Prior incantations:
- 📦 [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker): [Check out my contrib to the Tolkien Legendarium. LOL.]
- 🧪 [VA.gov APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api): [Modernizing tha VA.gov API affordances]

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that I once crafted a spell in FORTH that could transform source code into poetry? It was a magical fusion of art and programming!

Embrace the mystic arts of code, dear traveler, and let us embark on a wondrous journey together. Through the incantations of programming, we shall unlock the secrets of the digital realm and shape a world where magic and technology intertwine in harmony! ✨🌍✨
